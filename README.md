# Veil

Windows apps. Mac experience.

Veil is an open-source research and product effort to make Windows apps feel like native macOS windows on Apple Silicon Macs. The goal is not to build a generic VM manager. The goal is a Windows App Runtime for macOS: boot a Windows 11 Arm VM in the background, launch one Windows app, mirror that app window into a macOS `NSWindow`, and bridge input, clipboard, and files.

## Project Status

Veil is at the architecture and feasibility stage.

The first milestone is intentionally small:

1. Start a Windows 11 Arm VM from the macOS host.
2. Connect to a Windows guest agent.
3. Launch Notepad from macOS.
4. Track the Notepad `HWND`.
5. Render only that Notepad window as a macOS window.
6. Send keyboard and mouse input from macOS to Windows.
7. Map `Cmd+C` / `Cmd+V` to `Ctrl+C` / `Ctrl+V`.
8. Sync text clipboard both ways.

If this works, the project has a real foundation.

The source directories will be created as implementation starts. The current repository starts with documentation because the risk profile is architectural.

## Local Harness Smoke Test

The first executable loop is a fake host talking to a fake Windows guest agent:

```bash
cd harness/fake-agent
npm install
npm start
```

In a second terminal:

```bash
cd harness/fake-host
npm install
npm run launch:notepad
```

Expected output includes `agent.health.response`, `app.launch.response`, and `window.created` for `hwnd:0003029A`.

See [harness/README.md](harness/README.md) for details.

## macOS Host Probe

The first Swift host-side executable lives in `apps/mac-host`:

```bash
cd harness/fake-agent
npm start
```

In a second terminal:

```bash
cd apps/mac-host
swift test
swift run veil-host-probe
```

Expected output is a JSON launch result with Notepad app metadata and a `window.created` event.

## macOS Host Shell

The first SwiftUI shell shows agent status, Windows app metadata, and the latest Notepad launch event.

Run it directly:

```bash
cd apps/mac-host
swift test
swift run veil-host-shell
```

For the Codex desktop Run button, use:

```bash
./script/build_and_run.sh
```

That script builds `veil-host-shell`, stages `dist/Veil.app`, and launches it as a macOS app bundle.

If no external agent is listening at `VEIL_AGENT_URL` or `ws://127.0.0.1:18444`, the shell falls back to an internal demo agent so the Windows Apps and Notepad launch flow still work. Protocol and agent errors are still surfaced instead of being hidden by the demo fallback. Run `harness/fake-agent` when you want to test the real WebSocket harness path.

The app list supports selection. The current fake-agent harness can only launch Notepad, so other app ids are shown but blocked from launch until generic app launch support lands.

The shell also includes a VM Runtime panel. That panel is a capability, profile-status, and start-request boundary for the future Virtualization.framework implementation; it does not create or boot Windows yet.

The VM Runtime panel can create a default local Windows 11 Arm profile. This writes configuration only to the user's Application Support directory; it does not create a disk image, install Windows, include Windows media, or bypass licensing.

The profile can reference a user-provided installer image and virtual disk path. Veil checks that the stored paths still point to local files, that the macOS shared folder exists, and that the profile targets Windows Arm with usable CPU, memory, and disk settings before marking the profile boot-ready. Pressing Start currently exercises the service boundary and reports that VM boot is not implemented yet. It does not validate Windows media contents, create a disk image, or boot Windows yet.

## Open Source Principles

- No bundled Windows images, product keys, or proprietary Parallels assets.
- Bring-your-own Windows license and installer media.
- Clear separation between host app, guest agent, and protocol packages.
- Public protocol documentation before optimization.
- Small milestones that can be tested by contributors without owning the whole system.
